# Automated-Translation-for-Global-Business-Operations---NLP-Project

Tech Stack: Python, spaCy, TextBlob, MarianMT (HuggingFace), NLTK, Matplotlib

🔍 Project Overview
This project builds a scalable NLP-powered translation pipeline designed for multinational business operations. It handles technical documentation, product manuals, and internal communication by preserving context, sentiment, and domain-specific terminology.

⚙️ Key Features
Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging for context retention

Sentiment Analysis to maintain tone during translation

Word Sense Disambiguation for accurate handling of business terms

Custom Glossary Integration for technical jargon (e.g., automotive terms)

Translation using MarianMT Transformer Models

Visualization of linguistic structures using Matplotlib/Seaborn

📊 Impact
Achieved 100% entity preservation rate in critical translations

Delivered 75% reduction in turnaround time compared to manual translation

Applied in real-world simulation (e.g., BMW technical docs across 15+ countries)

📁 Use Cases
Automated translation of global product catalogs and repair manuals

NLP-driven localization for multinational operations

Multilingual support in retail/e-commerce settings

✅ Next Steps
Integrate live translation API for real-time use

Extend support to additional languages and domains

Implement human-in-the-loop feedback for continuous model refinement
